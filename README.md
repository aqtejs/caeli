#### Goal

This application aims to bring complete anonimity to conversation, whilst being a powerful tool to embed in your site in order to implement chat features.

#### Technology

The chat application is built on [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev) paired with [Socket.IO](https://socket.io), with these frameworks we can utilize to the fullest the **real-time** aspect of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org).

#### How does anonimity work here?

You can use all the features of the app without an account, **nothing gets saved** so you can have a private conversation in peace.

If you create an account you'll have all your settings and info sychronized across devices.
(*This feature is still not implemented*)

#### Contributions are welcome

If you want to fork the project or contribute to it you are more than welcome to do that, with regards to the [license](LICENSE) of course.

Even if you have feedback or want to discuss new ideas then, by all means, open as many issues as you want and help me understand your point of view.

##### Thanks and have fun!
